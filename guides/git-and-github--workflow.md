## Intro

This project uses [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [github](https://github.com/) to holds the remote repo.

## Product flow

Product Flow is how we change the product (the app) over time.

When we want to add a new code changes to the app, we follow this workflow:
1. create a new github issue
1. create a new branch for the issue
2. add commits to the branch
3. create a pull request from the branch
4. merge the pull request with squash merge
5. **NEVER DELETE A MERGED BRANCH**
